Batch-Incremental Ensemble Classifier (BIE)
You should imple-
ment the predict and partial fit functions in the outline of the classifier in my classifier.py.

Implement a tumbling window of size 100, creating and maintaining up to a maximum of 100 models.
Build a DecisionTreeClassifier on each of the batches/windows.
If you run the script run plot.py you will obtain a result like that in Figure 1. After you implement
the BIE classifier, you should run this script again, and submit (within a zip file with your name, e.g.,
Firstname LASTNAME.zip)
